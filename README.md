# size-matters
An example of what sort of size-savings minification and gzip actually get you. Made for my [blog post](http://matevi.sh/size-matters/) on the matter.

## Setting up the project
Setup is simple. 

    git clone https://github.com/ramatevish/size-matters.git
    cd size-matters
    npm install

## Running the project
Running is simple. 

    grunt

The various mangled, minified, and compressed files are located under /build in clearly labled folder. A nice summary of file sizes is printed for you. These sizes were used to in all graphs and statistics for the blog post.
